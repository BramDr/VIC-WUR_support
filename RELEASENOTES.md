### VIC-WUR.2.1.0 [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.3934363.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3934363)
Includes minor changes that affect the results to a limited degree, specifically: routing flow distance, industrial water demand, domestic water demand and livestock water demand. Includes all inputs for the anthropogenic impact modules as present in [VIC-WUR.2.1.0](https://github.com/wur-wsg/VIC/tree/VIC-WUR.2.1.0) [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.3971898.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3971898)

1. Removed paper related scripts/documents. These have been moved to [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/bramdr/papers). Currently only VIC related scripts/documents are included in this repository.
2. Updated the folder structure to remove redundand data. All data is located in the folder 'Data', all scripts are located in the folder 'Scripts'.
3. Included domain generation: single and/or multiple cell generation; single and/or multiple basin generation.
4. Added code formatting tools (R styler).
5. Bug fixes and code updates.
